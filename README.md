## My overall opinion (Mar, 2021)

The best way I ever invested $1,300 in myself.
> (Meaning, my gaming PC was cool too, but spending crazy amount of time for some questionable "fun" doesn't count as investing in yourself) 

Compared to classic education, this is much more useful and powerful. In 2018-2020, I was engaged in semi-classical education, and I think that it would be much more useful to leave only 2 of the 8 subjects studied at that time: Film and Business & Management, and study the rest, like Theory of Knowledge, occasionally at leisure. 
And, of course, $30,000 spent for this would be of much greater help if they were right in my hands now. 

Education at Yandex.Praktikum strengthens the willpower, allows you to go about your business and have time to fully study everything that you want and that will really benefit in the future. With medium effort, I could have studied<sup>*</sup> 2 Praktikum faculties, 2-4 school subjects, and have some personal life.
> \* (Well, that might be false cause sixteen-year-old's private life tends to take too much time).

Of course, partly, that's a wow effect, but facts will be facts, I'm planning to return to this writing later to reflect or maybe reconsider some thoughts.
